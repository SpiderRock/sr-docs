<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Series or Spread</strong></td><td>The auction initiator must supply an equity option series or spread.  This can be either a listed option series, an exchange eligible listed option spread, or a valid FLEX option series or spread.  Spreads can contain up to SIX option legs and may contain and equity leg.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Order Side</strong></td><td>The auction initiator must supply an series side (BUY or SELL) or a spread side (BUY/REG, SELL/INV).  Note that the initiator can choose the spread leg package including the leg sides.  As a result, if an initiator is starting an auction with their side visible they would typically chose to start with their side as BUY/REG but are not required to do so.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Limit Price</strong></td><td>The auction initiator must supply either a static or formula based limit price that is at least mid market or better relative to either exact OPRA NBBO levels or SpiderRock fair price (surface price) levels at the start of the auction process.  This limit price can be changed by the initiator at any time during the auction and will become effective in the next trial match if changed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best Price Offset</strong></td><td>The initiator may enter a Best Price Offset.  If supplied, this Best Price Offset will only be used in the final trial match at the completion of the alloted auction duration in order to reach and make a match.  This Best Price Offset value is not shown to responders prior to the final trial match.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Side/Price<br>Visibility</strong></td><td>The auction initiator can chose to reveal their side and price, their side only, or neither.  This choice can be changed during the auction but only in the direction of increasing visibility.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size Condition</strong></td><td><strong>All Or None</strong> or <strong>Quantity Or More</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Time Duration</strong></td><td><strong>15 Seconds</strong>, <strong>30 Seconds</strong>, <strong>60 Seconds</strong>, <strong>2 Minutes</strong>, <strong>5 Minutes</strong><br>This time selection sets the ultimate duration of the auction and encourages participants to negotiate price levels accordingly.  All Block auctions can be executed immediately at the initiator effective limit price (whether visible or not) which may result in the auction terminating before the target auction time has elapsed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Counterparties</strong></td><td>The initiator can choose which counterparties receive auction notices.  This is done by either specifying a list of named counterparties (either to include or exclude) or by electing to send notices to the entire SpiderConnect network or some combination.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Identity Disclosure</strong></td><td>The initiator can choose to identify themselves to some or all of their notice counterparties.  If an initiator chooses to identify themselves to a counterparty then that counterparty will be identified to the initiator if/when they respond.  Similarly if an initiator does NOT identify themselves to a responder then the identity of that responder will NOT be revealed to the initiator if/when they respond. Note that in some cases initiators that identify themselves to a responder may also choose to pay that responder a commission directly should the initiator and responder trade with each other.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="block-auction-responder-parameters">Block Auction Responder Parameters<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Block Auction Responder Parameters" title="Direct link to Block Auction Responder Parameters" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-responder-parameters">​</a></h3>
<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>AuctionNoticeID</strong></td><td>Auction responders must respond with the specific (unique) ID from the associated auction notice that idetifies the individual auction to which they are responding.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Series or Spread</strong></td><td>(Optional) If suplied must be compatible with the initiator leg(s). If a response does not include an option series or spread the response will be deemed a response to the noticed option series or option spread package. If for a spread the response will be deemed to be a response with the legs oriented as they were in the auction notice. When responding to spreads it is possible for the responder to use the same order side as the initiator (eg. BUY/REG vs BUY/REG) but the opposite leg sides and limit price sign.  This type of response will be accepted as valid and automatically inverted within SpiderRock Connect to align with other responses.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Order Side</strong></td><td>Auction responders must supply a series side (BUY or SELL) or a spread side (BUY/REG, SELL/INV). If the initiator has revealed a side the responder must be the opposite the initiator.  Otherwise the responder can respond on either side (or both).  If the initiator subsequently reveals a side then all incompatible (same direction) responses will be immediately cancelled with nothing done.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Limit Price</strong></td><td>Auction responders must supply either a static or formula based limit price. This limit price can be changed at any time during the auction and will become effective in the next trial match if changed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best Price Offset</strong></td><td>Responders may enter a Best Price Offset.  If supplied, this Best Price Offset will only be used to join other responders.  Also, if a presumtive match occurs within SpiderRock Connect and is subject to an price improvement auction on an exchange then any remaining Best Price Offset room will be forwarded to that exchange for consideration in the on-exchange secondary auction. If more than one responder is part of the presumtive match then the least common remaining Best Price Offset value will be forwarded to the exchange for consideration.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th>Limit Types</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Static</strong></td><td><strong>MatchPrice = StaticPrice</strong> <br>Maintains an unadjusted price for the life of the order. This is also known as “Package” for spreads than contain more than one leg.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Delta <br> (2-way)</strong></td><td><strong>MatchPrice = Delta2WayPrice + refDelta * dUPrc + 0.5 * refGamma * dUPrc * dUPrc</strong> WHERE: <br><strong>dUPrc = uPrcNbboMid - URefPrice</strong> (URefType=Mid) OR <br><strong>dUPrc = uPrcNbboCross - URefPrice</strong> (URefType=Cross) <br>This limit type is used to dynamically adjust the limit price on outright option series as well as option spreads with and without stock legs. For spreads that include a stock leg Delta (2-way) will allow the user to adjust on a delta that is different from the stock ratio used on the package.  refDelta, refGamma, and uRefType and uRefPrice can be selected by the party entering the order or they can default to SpiderRock suggested values. Note that uPrcNbboCross is interpreted as relative to the underlier direction that would be necessary to hedge the series or spread refDelta. (ie. BID for positive refDelta, and ASK for negative refDelta). Also note that the initiator and responder(s) do NOT need to agree on the refDelta, refGamma, uRefType, or uRefPrice</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Delta <br> (1-way)</strong></td><td><strong>MatchPrice = Delta1WayPrice</strong> OR <strong>Delta1WayPrice + refDelta * dUPrc + 0.5 * refGamma * dUPrc * dUPrc</strong> (whichever is less agressive) where: <br><strong>dUPrc = uPrcNbboMid - URefPrice</strong> (URefType=Mid) OR <br><strong>dUPrc = uPrcNbboCross - URefPrice</strong> (URefType=Cross) <br>This limit type differs from Delta (2-way) in that the adjustment is bounded by the original (starting) limit.  This limit type is most useful for clients who wish to take advantage of a dynamic limit but have a level above or below which they do not want to trade.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Neutral</strong></td><td><strong>MatchPrice = NeutralPrice + StockDir * 0.01 * StockShares * URefPrice</strong> <br>This LimitType is available as a convenience for option spreads that contain a stock leg. NeutralPrice can be interpreted as the price for the option legs of the spread by themselves. The resulting MatchPrice is static for the life of the order (does not change as all parts are also static).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RC Premium</strong></td><td><strong>MatchPrice = NeutralPrice - StockDir * StrikePrice</strong> <br>This limit type is only available for reversal/conversion strategies and is also for convenience as the resulting MatchPrice remains static for the life of the order.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="block-auction-notices">Block Auction Notices<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Block Auction Notices" title="Direct link to Block Auction Notices" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-notices">​</a></h2>
<p>At the start of each block auction an <strong>AuctionNotice</strong> message will be sent to all eligible responders. In addition, <strong>AuctionState</strong> messages are sent at the conclusion of each auction trial match (once per second while the auction is running).</p>
<p>SpiderRock AuctionNotice messages typically contain a significant amount of markup detail such as OPRA and Stock NBBO levels, surface volatilities, prices, and associated greeks.  This information is provided on a best effort basis and is believed to be accurate enough to allow auction responding without reference to other systems. However, clients are always encouraged to use whatever information is available in order to make the most accurate decisions possible.</p>
<p>These notice messages are the primary mechanism through which information about an auction is communicated to responders.  These messages can be subscribed to and interacted with in a number of ways as described below. Note that very little about the block auction responding process is particularly latency sensitive.  As a result, all of the methods below are equivalently competitive.</p>
<p>Responders may receive notices via SpiderRock MLink servers (electronic notices), via automated ICE Chat notices (chat notices), and via the SpiderRock TradeTool (application notices).  Each individual responder notice will reflect the initiator counterparty and identity disclosure parameters regardless of delivery method.</p>
<p>In addition, at regular once second intervals trial match notices (AuctionState messages) will be distributed via MLink servers and also via the SpiderRock TradeTool.</p>
<p>Finally, if an initiator changes something about their order (eg. improves the public limit price or changes their visibility settings) then a new <strong>AuctionNotice</strong> update will sent to all potential responders that received the original auction notice.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spiderrock-tradetool">SpiderRock TradeTool<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SpiderRock TradeTool" title="Direct link to SpiderRock TradeTool" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#spiderrock-tradetool">​</a></h3>
<p>SpiderRock Connect block auctions are fully integrated into the SpiderRock TradeTool. This webapp tool can be run either from within a Chrome browser or as a stand-alone Electron application on both Windows and Mac desktops. This tool allows users to set a <strong>UserActionFilter</strong>, see block auction notices in a pending auction queue, and respond directly.</p>
<p>This is the recommended way to see and interact with all SpiderRock block auctions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ice-chat">ICE Chat<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ICE Chat" title="Direct link to ICE Chat" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#ice-chat">​</a></h3>
<p>SpiderRock Connect operates an ICE Chat Bot that is capable of automatically forwarding AuctionNotice messages to potential responders via ICE Chat. These notices are formatted as chat messages and are intended to be both human readable and machine parseable.</p>
<p>It is possible to directly respond (via chat) to the bot. The bot will parse responses and ask for confirmation. If confirmed, a response will become a live block auction response.  This mechinism is described more fully in the <strong>ICE Chat Bot</strong> section.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mlink-subscriptions">MLink Subscriptions<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MLink Subscriptions" title="Direct link to MLink Subscriptions" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#mlink-subscriptions">​</a></h3>
<p>Both AuctionNotice and AuctionState messages are available via the SpiderRock <strong>MLink/WebSocket API</strong>. To get access a potential responder must secure and MLink API Key, connect to an MLink/WebSocket server and make a subscription for both AuctionNotice and AuctionState messages.</p>
<p>Once subscribed, auction messages relevant for the user/client firm associated with the MLink API Key are forwarded immediately.  Also, AuctionNotice messages that are delivered in this fashion will contain as much information as the initiator has chosen to reveal. For example, if the initiator has chosen to reveal their identity to you then their identity will be contained in the AuctionNotice message you receive.</p>
<p>MLink/WebSocket connections may also be used to respond directly to AuctionNotices.  This is done by sending an NoticeResponse message and processing the associated NoticeExecReport messages. This is a somewhat simplied (relative to FIX) method of responding to auction notices, particularly for clients that do not currently operate production quality live FIX infrastructure.</p>
<p>Alternatively, subscribers can respond to MLink auction notices by sending a FIX NewOrderSingle or NewOrderMultileg message to a SpiderRock Order Entry Gateway and processing the resulting ExecReport messages for that order.</p>
<p>Note that responses can be indicated as &#x27;Live&#x27; and immediately included in the auction. Alternatively, they can be marked as &#x27;Staged&#x27; which will result in staged auction response order appearing in the order handling queue of SpiderRock TradeTool(s) of associated client firm users. This will allow the order to be reviewed from a TradeTool by a tool user and submitted as a live order or rejected/ignored at that point. This allows a client firm to pre-filter auction notices for those of highest relevance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="block-auction-mechanics">Block Auction Mechanics<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Block Auction Mechanics" title="Direct link to Block Auction Mechanics" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-mechanics">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trial-matches">Trial Matches<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Trial Matches" title="Direct link to Trial Matches" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#trial-matches">​</a></h3>
<p>Once a block auction starts successive trial matches will be run at one second intervals for the alloted auction duration with one final trial match occuring prior to the expiration of the auction.  While trial matches are spaced one second appart, the execution of an individual trial match processes is much faster (typically &lt; 1ms).  Both initiating and responding orders can be cancelled at any time however, once a trial match begins all orders are firm and cannot be cancelled until that trial match concludes.</p>
<p>At the start of a trial match SpiderRock Connect first determines a set of valid auction responses that are able to fully execute in that trial match. Note that is is possible for a valid response in an earlier trial match to no longer be valid in a later trial match (eg, responder&#x27;s firm has placed a symbol on it&#x27;s restricted list or a spread that would result in stock being traded short no longer has a locate available).</p>
<p>Next SpiderRock Connect will identify a relevent stock NBBO level, resolve all formula based limits (if any), and round initiator and responder limits to an appropriate potential match price level.  Note that individual orders can either round exact (99/1) or round fuzzy (90/10) in the direction of making the order more conservative.  This choice is established by user preference at the trading account level.</p>
<p>In most cases all potential match price levels will be to 2 decimal places.  In the special case of a spread that contains an stock leg with a leg size not equal to 100 the initiator&#x27;s limit price will be rounded (50/50) to 4 decimal places and all potential match price levels will be to 4 decimal places spaced $0.01 appart with the 3rd and 4th decimal place being the 3rd and 4th decimal place of the initiator&#x27;s rounded limit price.</p>
<p>During the process of forming price levels some specific rules apply.</p>
<p>• No responder price level can be equal to or through the opposing OPRA NBBO level.  For example if NBBO is 1.12 - 1.17 for a single series and a responder attempts to SELL at 1.08 that response limit will be adjusted to 1.13 (one penny inside the NBBO BID).  For a spread order the bounding NBBO will be the NBBO level from the individual leg markets (options and stock).</p>
<p>• No initiator price level can be more than 0.25 through OPRA NBBO levels.  For example, if NBBO is 2.54 - 2.75 for a single series and an initiator attempts to BUY at 3.10 their limit price will be adjusted to 3.00.  Similarly, for a spread order the bounding NBBO will be the NBBO level from the individual leg markets (options and stock).</p>
<p>• If an initiator has already advertised their limit price (either at the start of the auction or in the immediately prior trial) all responder limit prices will be stopped at the initiators public price level.  For example, if the initiator is advertising a willingness to BUY at 3.42 and a responders sends an order to SELL with a limit of 3.40 then the responders limit will be adjusted to 3.42 to match the initiators already public price.  However, if a presumptive match occurs at the 3.42 level the initiator that offered through the initiator level will be deemed to have a best price of 3.40 less any best price offset for the purpose of notifying an exchange of the responders willingness to trade at a better level.</p>
<p>• If a responder has an active best price increment that increment can be activated (used) only if a better competive response is available in the trial match.  For a response to be deemed competive it must be for at least 100 cn or 1/4 of the initiator&#x27;s size.</p>
<p>Next, SpiderRock Connect will form all responses into a response book.  This book will be one-sided if the initiator has revealed a price and two-sided otherwise.  Note that the response book price levels may be in either 2 or 4 decimal places (depending on the item being auctioned) but will be spaced at least $0.01 apart.</p>
<p>All responder size conditions will be considered and an available size (to the initiator) at each response book price level will be determined.</p>
<p>If it is possible for the initiator to cross (trade with) one or more responders at one or more price levels, subject to all initiator and responder conditions, the best such price level (from the initiator&#x27;s perpective) will become the presumptive match price and a presumptive match process will be started. Otherwise, the results of the presumptive match will be advertised to the initiator and all SpiderRock Connect subscribers.  This notification will be via electronic message (MLink) and also via the SpiderRock Trade Tool.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="presumptive-match-process">Presumptive Match Process<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Presumptive Match Process" title="Direct link to Presumptive Match Process" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#presumptive-match-process">​</a></h3>
<p>At the start of presumptive match process a provisional responder side allocation will be determined on a size pro-rata basis and a crossing order forwarded to an exchanged selected by SpiderRock Connect.  This crossing order may include a least common residual Best Price Offset value for use competitively on the selected exchange.  If some or all of a presumptive match is broken up on exchange then the responder side balance (if any) will be re-allocated in a pro-rata fashion amoungst the participating responders.</p>
<p>When allocating amoungst responders SpiderRock Connect will cap all individual responder quantities at the presumptive match quantity and apply any responder size conditions to determine an available responder quantity for allocation purposes. If a responder client firm has more than one order participating in a presumptive match then the total quantity of all of the participating client firm orders will be capped at presumptive match quantity with individual client firm responder orders reduced pro-rata to ensure the client firm total does not exceed the presumptive match quantity.</p>
<p>Responder pro-rata allocation will then be:</p>
<p><strong>Allocated Quantity</strong> = <strong>Match Quantity</strong> * <strong>Responder Quantity</strong> / <strong>SUM(Responder Quantities)</strong></p>
<p>Any required rounding will be conducted to favor larger responses.</p>
<p>If necessary, to satisify exchange or reg NMS requirements for single option series, SpiderRock Connect will sweep away NBBO markets prior to beginning an ISO cross on a selected exchange.</p>
<p>If possible, SpiderRock Connect will utilize QCC style auctions or other non-competitive on-exchange auction processes.</p>
<p>If an exchange rejects a cross attempt SpiderRock Connect may attempt the cross on another exchange immediately.  If all exchange crossing possibilities have been exhausted SpiderRock connect will declare the presumptive match broken and all orders will be cancelled with nothing done.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fees">Fees<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fees" title="Direct link to Fees" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#fees">​</a></h3>
<p>SpiderRock Connect will pay all exchange fees associated with the selected exchange and will arrange for all resulting executions to be delivered via CMTA to the approriate initiator and responder accounts.  Responders and/or initiators pay commissions to or receive commissions from SpiderRock Connect as per their individual initiator and responder agreements.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/SpiderRockConnectATS/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">SpiderRock Connect ATS</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/FlashAuctions/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Flash Auctions</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-initiator-parameters">Block Auction Initiator Parameters</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-responder-parameters">Block Auction Responder Parameters</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#initiator-and-responder-limit-types">Initiator and Responder Limit Types</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-notices">Block Auction Notices</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#spiderrock-tradetool">SpiderRock TradeTool</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#ice-chat">ICE Chat</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#mlink-subscriptions">MLink Subscriptions</a></li></ul></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#block-auction-mechanics">Block Auction Mechanics</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#trial-matches">Trial Matches</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#presumptive-match-process">Presumptive Match Process</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/docs/SpiderRockConnectATS/BlockAuctions/#fees">Fees</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">
