In the\nderivative space, the TCA concept is fairly new. Due to the nature of a derivative, which is tied to an\nunderlying asset, simple equity style arrival time TCA metrics are not appropriate and often give spurious\nanswers. At SpiderRock, we believe that measuring TCA for derivatives is about more than simply the price\nimprovement at time of execution. This method speaks to improvement but is silent on what you really pay\nthe market. We believe a better approach is to turn the question around to estimate what your counterparty(s)\nare likely making (or losing) when they trade with you.

We also assume that they can\nget out of the trade they executed with you at mid-market in the derivatives market 10 minutes after they\ntraded with you, all without paying any transaction fees. Given these basic assumptions, we can precisely\nmeasure what your counter-party made (or lost) trading with you and, conversely, what you made or lost\ntrading with them.

This is why we measure\nexecution performance on a \u201C10-minute forward delta neutral PnL\u201D metric, as opposed to looking at the\nprice improvement at time of execution. When trading options, how much do you pay the market to trade is\nthe same as asking how much do you pay the market makers to cross bid/ask prices. The answer is half the\nspread between bid/ask prices. The trick to reduce this half spread cost is to time the crossing of the\nbid/ask prices so that it corresponds to a contraction of the spread from its average width. In this dynamic,\ncomparing your fill price to the mid-market mark 10 minutes after execution when prices revert to a normal\nstate, often translates into a mid-market or close-to-mid-market fill. Without micro-market dynamic\nmeasurement techniques, a market participant would most likely cross the market blindly and pay half the\nspread to the market makers. With precise micro-market dynamic measurement techniques, the market\nparticipant can take advantage of the mean reverting characteristic of the derivative market and optimize the\ntiming of crossing the market so that the trade would have a high likelihood of being at the mid-market mark\nor better a few minutes after it was executed."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(r.p,{children:"The SpiderRock Connect model mimics how market makers behave and help market participants reduce their\ntransaction costs.
